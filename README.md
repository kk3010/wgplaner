### Project abstract
The goal of our app is to make the life in a WG (Shared apartment) easier.
For that purpose our app offer a shopping list feature, where the users can add items to a shared shopping list. Our Split feature allows the user to split up costs they have as a household and so always track who paied what and who owes what to whom. 
In the shoppinglist view the users can easily add bought items directly to split.

Our Techstack consists of NestJS (using typescript) with PostgreSQL in the Backend and VueJS (using typescript) in the frontend. For our testing we decided to use Jest.
We use SSE (Server Sent Events) to update changes from one user to all users directly.
